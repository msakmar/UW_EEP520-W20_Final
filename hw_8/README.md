This week, you do not need to run tests. Just build a project that implements <u>one</u> of the following behaviors. We will clone your repo into a `klavins/enviro:alpha` image and run
```bash
esm start
enviro
```
to see to what extend you got the behavior to work. You are, of course, welcome to try more than one problem.

1. Using static elements, create a maze like environment. Put a robot at the start and have it explore until it finds the end of the maze. Use range sensors, wall following behaviors, and perhaps some kind of memory of where the robot has been.
